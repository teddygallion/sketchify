# Module 2 Final Project Dev log

## 12/04/2023:
**7:30pm - 9:30pm** 

	- Brainstormed ideas for app concept
	- Background research for HTML canvas tag, utilities.[^1]
	- Researched options for picking colors in HTML

## 12/05/2023:
**10:00am - 12:00pm** 

	- Built wireframe of site
	- Implemented drawing functions and clear canvas functionality.
	- Added color change function, implemented UI for picking color. 

**1:00pm - 4:00pm** 

	- Research on how mouse movements are registered in-browser to improve mouse tracking. 
	- Background research on other implementations of js drawing apps to 
		determine how to best implement mouse tracking[^1] (see footnotes below for sources) [!4]

## 12/08/2023
**10:00am - 12:00pm** 

	- Worked on css styling for canvas/toolbar positioning. 

**12:00pm - 4:00pm** 

	- More work on UI/styling using flexbox
	- Additional background research on HTML canvas elements and user events. [^2][^3]

## 12/10/2023 
**10:00am - 3:00pm** 
	
	- Further research on JS mouse events [^4]
	- For purposes of fixing my drawing tool I tried about six different mouse position properties,
		printing their values to the screen and using these values to set cursor position.  
	- These methods either did not improve cursor accuracy or made accuracy worse. 

# 12/11/2023
**4:30pm - 6:30pm** 

	- Further research on other implementations of JS drawing apps [^5][^6]
	without using external libraries or frameworks. 
	- At this point I was lost as to what could be going wrong, so I shifted focus 
	  to other aspects of my project, i.e. CSS styling, accessibility features, 
	  and brainstorming stretch goals. 

# 12/12/2023
**4:30 - 6:30pm** 

	- Found out exactly what was going wrong with my canvas tag, implemented appropriate solution, refactoring code.
